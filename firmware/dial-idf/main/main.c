/*
 * Orion dial — app wiring.
 *
 * Structure:
 *   dial_display  LCD/touch/LVGL bring-up + the LVGL task and lock
 *   dial_state    snapshot store + UI->worker command queue + input stamp
 *   dial_ui       screen router (LVGL task) + screens
 *   worker_task   (here) the single network task: Wi-Fi -> OAuth -> MCP ->
 *                 command/poll loop, as a supervisor state machine. Every
 *                 failure is a phase + backoff, never a dead end.
 *
 * Threading: the worker never touches LVGL; it commits to dial_state and the
 * router's dispatcher renders. Knob callbacks (esp_timer task) only feed the
 * router's atomic accumulator. LVGL event callbacks already hold the LVGL
 * mutex and must not re-lock it.

/* ---- mDNS ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * A stable orion-dial-xxxxxx.local hostname stands in for the DHCP IP in the
 * OAuth redirect_uri below. An IP-based redirect_uri silently invalidates the
 * registered OAuth client the moment the router hands out a new lease — the
 * DCR client_id is registered per redirect_uri, so a changed IP meant a
 * changed URI, which meant dial_oauth_ensure_client's cache-compare (below)
 * quietly re-registered a NEW client and orphaned the one the user had
 * already consented to, forcing them back through the QR flow. This bit the
 * owner repeatedly. mDNS names don't change with the lease, so once
 * registered this class of forced re-link can't happen again.
 *
 * Phones resolve ".local" out of the box — Bonjour on iOS/macOS, NSD on
 * Android — with no app install, which is exactly what's on hand to scan the
 * on-screen QR, so it's the right redirect host for this flow.
