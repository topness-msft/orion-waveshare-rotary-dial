/*
 * The single app-state store. The network worker (and only it) commits device
 * truth; input handlers commit optimistic UI intent; the LVGL-side dispatcher
 * polls the generation counter and re-renders the active screen on change.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - Readers take a full snapshot with dial_state_get() — never hold pointers
 *    into the store.
 *  - Writers mutate inside dial_state_commit()'s callback — the store mutex is
 *    held for the duration, so keep mutators tiny and never block in them.
 *  - The quiet-period input gate (dial_state_stamp_input / last_input_us) is
 *    the proven resync mechanism: the worker only reads the bed back after
 *    2.5s of no input, so a poll can never land mid-interaction.
